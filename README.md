# Storyboard Prototype

Storyboard Prototype is based on Node and the JavaScript library three.js.

Thanks to the storyboard prototype, three-dimensional storyboards can be created alone or with several participants in an online workshop. The final result of the story can be downloaded as an XML-file and afterwarts be imported into the modelling software [Scene2Model](https://austria.omilab.org/psm/content/scene2model/info?view=home). This software automatically transforms the three-dimensional storyboard into diagrammatic models.

Storyboard is a design thinking method, which is great for telling a story, explaining a process, showing a passage of time or illustrating the user experience with a service or a product. A sequence of events is told by using three-dimensional scenes with characters of [SAP Scenes](https://apphaus.sap.com/resource/scenes)
